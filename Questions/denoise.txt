Question 6:

Scenario 1: Which denoising method would be most suitable for me if I have only a few noisy microscopy images (TEM or SEM) and no ground truth, such as clean images? Options include Noise2Noise, Noise2Void, Denoise Vision Transformer, Zero-Shot Noise2Noise, or Denoised Task Adaptation for Few-Shot Learning.

Scenario 2: Which denoising method would be most suitable if I have a few traffic videos recorded by a camera on ABC Road and want to enhance their quality by reducing noise? No ground truth are available.
